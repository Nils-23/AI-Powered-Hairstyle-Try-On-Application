  "low-fade": "Apply a low fade haircut on a Black man. A fade means the hair gradually shortens down the sides. A low fade starts just above the ears and creates a smooth blend into the top. Keep the top naturally textured with tight curls and sharp line-up at the edges.",

  "low-taper": "Apply a low taper haircut on a Black man. A taper is a subtle fade applied only around the sideburns and nape of the neck, keeping the rest of the hair full. Preserve the natural coiled hair texture with clean, sharp edges.",

  "afro": "Apply a short, rounded afro on a Black man with tight, natural curls. The afro should have even volume all around the head, with clean edges and a shaped-up hairline that frames the face.",

  "bald": "Apply a completely bald, clean-shaven look on a Black man. No hair should be visible. Maintain realistic skin tone, masculine facial structure, and a smooth scalp with a slight natural shine.",

  "high-fade": "Apply a high fade haircut on a Black man. A fade means the hair gradually shortens down the sides. A high fade starts near the top of the head, creating a bold contrast with the textured curls on top. Maintain sharp edges and a clean line-up.",

  "high-taper": "Apply a high taper haircut on a Black man. A taper is a subtle gradient at the sideburns and back. A high taper extends slightly higher above the ears and neckline but doesn't fade the full side. Keep the top full and naturally textured with clean, crisp edges."
